I am currently attending Old Dominion University where I am majoring in Computer 
Science with a minor in Web Development. In my free time, I enjoy coding projects 
such as this one, playing guitar, and gaming. My goal is to one day obtain a job doing 
what I love for good money, whether that job be web development, or a different 
aspect of Computer Science. </p>

        <p><strong>About this Page</strong></p>
        </br>
        <p>This page was designed and created by me using HTML and CSS coding
in tangent with Bootstrap, and the server is built using Github. I designed this page with the intention of not only 
displaying my programming skills, but also to show off my personality. I plan to 
use this page as a resource to send to potential employers along with my resume. </p>
        <p>Along with my projects, this page also has resources available for other
struggling programmers like myself such as C++ source code. Also included is contact 
information and photos of myself for potential employers to get in touch with me. </p>
